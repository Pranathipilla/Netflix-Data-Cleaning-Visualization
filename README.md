**Features**

  * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The script cleans and processes the raw data, handles missing values, and removes duplicates.
  * **Data Visualization:** It generates various plots to visualize key trends and insights, including:
      * Movie vs. TV show counts.
      * Content additions over time (yearly and monthly).
      * Top 10 countries with the most content.
      * Top 10 directors and genres.
      * Distribution of content ratings.

**Key Insights**

The analysis performed in the script revealed several key insights:

  * The current recommendation system is a **content-based filtering model** that uses the director, genres, and country to suggest new titles.
  * The recommendation function could be integrated into a user interface to provide real-time suggestions.
  * The visualizations show trends in Netflix's content release strategy, its global presence, and the distribution of ratings across its library.
